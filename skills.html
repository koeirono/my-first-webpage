    <p>I am someone who enjoys solving problems and making things work better—whether it’s helping a team stay organized or finding the right way to handle a tricky situation. I’m good at building real connections with people, and I take pride in being someone others can count on. I’ve learned how to manage my time, work under pressure, and keep things moving, even when plans change. I’m also comfortable picking up new tools and systems, and right now I’m diving into software engineering to grow that side of me. I like learning, staying curious, and doing work that feels meaningful and practical.</p>
